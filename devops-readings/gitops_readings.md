[GitOps Best Practices](https://medium.com/@cloudcomputingtechnologies/gitops-best-practices-2ef73b9b7def)

In 2017, GitOps was initially started as a method to do cluster management and app delivery for Kubernetes. It has since then been used for all cloud-native applications as well.
At its core, GitOps uses Git as the sole source of truth. It alerts the engineer on any discrepancies between Git and all thatâ€™s running in the cluster. In case of any differences, the reconcilers in Kubernetes are used to rollback the cluster or update automatically.
